## 🎮 Game Description

**Cycle of Crime** is a browser-based 3D role-playing game with a repeating storyline filled with betrayal, undercover NPCs, and mission twists. The player enters a criminal underworld, receives deadly assignments, and slowly realizes they’re always one step behind the law. The twist? The very person assigning the mission is a cop in disguise.

> “Do the job... but don’t get caught. Oh wait — too late.”
